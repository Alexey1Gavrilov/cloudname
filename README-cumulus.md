# The Cumulus branch

The `cumulus` branch is a major rewrite of the Cloudname libraries. Useless
stuff is removed with a vengeance and some of the (intented and unintended)
design decisions are reverted and/or changed - still with a vengeance.

The final version won't be compatible with the first versions at all.
