Smokey, this is not 'Nam. This is bowling. There are rules.

* if it doesn't build and pass all the tests it doesn't get pushed to
  the master branch.

* keep things simple.  most of this is not application code, it is
  infrastructural code and infrastructural code is all about the user.

* please discuss API changes or additions with bborud AT gmail.com
